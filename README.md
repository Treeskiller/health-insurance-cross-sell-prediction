# health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction
An insurance company that provides health insurance to customers wants to get into vehicle insurance. The problem is to help companies build models to predict whether last year's policyholders (customers) will also be interested in the vehicle insurance offered by the company. This enables insurance companies to predict future insurance sales, adjust corporate strategies in advance, and reduce investment risks while maximizing profits. My motivation for solving is to obtain and practice the ability to analyze and processing data and building the ability of the machine learning model to predict results by combining problems in real life.
The input to my predictor is CSV format data. I did the data exploration first by drawing Distribution, Countplot, Boxplot and Correlation Matrix. I did the feature engineering by StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder and feature selection by SelectKBest. I then established LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier, LGBMClassifier, CatBoostClassifier and DNN 7 machine learning models and used RandomizedSearchCV to turn the hyperparameters. I used the 7 models to output the probability of whether a customer will buy the insurance. Finally, I compared the results between the models by AUC (Area Under Curve) metric and blended the models which have good performance.
The program use Python.
